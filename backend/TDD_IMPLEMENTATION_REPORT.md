### Next Steps

The development team should now proceed with the **GREEN phase** of TDD, implementing the minimal code necessary to make each test pass, followed by the **REFACTOR phase** to optimize and improve code quality while maintaining test coverage.

This systematic approach will ensure a high-quality, maintainable, and reliable API that meets all business requirements and handles edge cases gracefully.
